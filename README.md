# Cornhole Boards

## Purpose
This build was a donation for Big Brothers Big Sisters. Six boards (3 sets) were built for a cornhole tournament fundraiser. The boards need to be built for wear and tear. Either the agency would use or we would give it away as a prize. 

## Materials
The frame and legs will be made out of 2x4s. The top will be 1/2" sanded plywood. And, the fastners to hold the legs in place will be lag bolts, washers, and wing nuts. 

The finish will be spray paint and multiple coats of PolyAcrylic to keep the shine down. 

A router template will be needed to cut a perfect 6" circle. The local library has a makerspace with a laser cutter. This will be used to cut out a template from 1/4" balsa wood.
