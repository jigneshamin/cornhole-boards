# What I learned building cornhold boards

This project's goal was efficiency and speed. The design was simple: a rectangle frame, rectangle board, and legs that angled to raise the board exactly 12".

I designed one board, but had to build 6 to complete 3 sets for donation. I decided to build out one all the way, then understand how to serialize each step to effiencly built the others. Overall this worked well for learning, but each set turned out slightly different since I made small improvisations between each set.

I had hardware ideas on how to fasten the boards to the frame and legs to the frame, but decided to finalize the ideas after the fits. This was a useful technique to let some of the build come to fruition and design from the built products.

The finishing of the boards was not ideal. This was my first time both using paint and including artistic design. Spray paints are not my favorite, and I prefer brushing paint. And, I would rather outsource artistic licenses in the future.

## Design

### Using SketchUp

There were a few new learning opportunities with this design. I had to find the correct angle for the legs so that the back of the board would be 12" off the ground. The simpler parts of the design were the 24" x 48" x 0.5" piece of plywood board, the 6" diameter hole in the board, and the 2" x 4" frame under the board. This was done with the shapes and push-pull tools. Finally, I raised the entire cornhole board up 12" off the ground plane.

For the leg components, the 2" x 4" x 12" pieces were built first. Then, I angled the leg under the board to "fit" under the top. I rounded the top of the legs in anticipation that it will rub when retracting the legs out. I use the offset tool to round out the leg.

I did not measure or test the leg's movement and rotation under the board. This will prove to be a significant miss and time waste during the leg fitting.

For the angle of the leg, I created a rectangle under the board (and added the grass texture for asthetics). With this plane under the leg and portion of the legs "poking through", I intersected and exploded the component. This allowed me to remove the material that needs to be cut and measured the angle at which the leg stood on the ground. This would be my miter setting.

### Designing templates

I was overconfident in my ability to draw a 6" circle and cut a perfect circle with the jigsaw in a scrap piece of wood. This may be worthwhile to keep trying, but this go around, my jigsaw skills are terrible. The first set suffered with a freehanded circle template, but the flush trim router worked beautifully.

Given router trim process worked well, I focused on the template. I had an inspiration to use the free hobbyist makerspace at the local library and inquire about using their laser cutters. I thought I could take a scrap 0.75" piece of plywood and have them cut out the circle. They gladly helped, but ended up using 0.25" balsa wood that burned right through it. The 0.75" was too thick for the hobbyist laser cutter.

Thinking through the design of templates will be important for finer pieces or other volume projects.

## Procure

### Counting the cutlist

Sanded plywood sheets were used for the cornhole top, so 2 sheets were purchased. The rest is made out of 2" x 4" and required some calculations. Because I was making 4 sets, meaning 8 of my designs, I kept thinking in terms of 4 instead of 8. So, I ended up purchasing less 2" x 4"s than I needed. This is super annoying and a major issue with my capabilities.

### Counting the hardware

During the assembly, I had to procure more screws. Going forward, I plan to do a quick round estimate of how many screws or pieces of hardware are needed and at that to the cut list.

## Cuts

### Using the cicular saw for long rips

I have not had much experience in making long, straight cuts with the circular saw. Plus, using my jobsite table saw to rip a 48" x 96" sheet of plywood seemed a bit unsafe. I decided to cut the 96" length down to two 48" x 48" sheets. Sounds like a no brainer, but helpful to type out that I would rather make a 48" -> 48" cut, than 96" -> 24" cut. I placed the 2" x 4"s under the sheet, marked the ends, and used a drywall framing square to draw the line. Using a scrap piece of board as a "safety guide", I tried to focus intently on using my eyes, hands and steadiness to follow the line rather than the guide.

I learned that a balanced, downward pressure on the saw to keep it flush and slowly moving is key. I may have been too timid with the saw before, but using it more, I have learned how to steadily guide it through the cut, rather than adjusting along the cut.

### Cutting mitered frames

I decided to miter the components of the frame to have a nice cornered fit. The process ended up being pretty annoying as I had to make many cuts. For each component of the frame, I made 2 cuts at the ends. There are 4 components to the frame, and 8 frames to build. So, that is 64 cuts.

### Using the jig saw router templates

Similar to the circular saw, the learning here was to apply downward pressure with the non-trigger hand. The non-trigger hand needs to apply downward pressure to keep the saw flush with the board and needs to apply the smooth turns needed for rounding out cuts.

Initially, I pushed the jig saw through the cuts. This led to cuts going outside the lines. But, a downward pressure and slow turns all with the non-trigger hand is the key to smooth jig saw cuts.

Ultimately, I learned that for router templates, the best is to be able to use the laser cutter on 0.25" board, if possible.

## Fit

### Order of assembly

As mentioned before, I wanted to build out one set first to test how I can improve speed and process for the other two. With my mitered frame pieces, I fit the frames together, then I checked how the board sit on top. Once that was verified, I check the how the legs woud work. I noticed here that the legs were going to be difficult as my design did not factor how the legs would rest on the board when extracted.

### Positioning the legs

The legs were the biggest miss during design. I spent way to much time fitting each leg. The tricky aspect of the legs were the pilot hole position to anchor the leg to the frame, the shape of the leg, and the angle of the feet. Each of these three are different for each cornhole set.

I attempted to fit the first board and repeat the shapes and pilot holes for the remaining boards. I ended up drilling the pilot holes at the same location for each frame. Then, I played with the shape of the legs (rounded tops or milled widths) to ensure a good fit and no rubbing while I clamped the board on the frame. I switched between inserting the leg with a spare lag screw, rotating the legs, and messing with the jig saw or redrilling the holes. It was not a great process.

Going forward, I should spend a bit more time on SketchUp to virtualize the fit and form. But, leave some capacity to pull out the geometry, pencil, and paper to physically test the fit and form. I rushed through this process wanting an easy fit. But, it takes sometime to make adjustments, especially more complex adjustments that involve angles and moving components.

## Assemble

### Fastening the frames

I did not like the idea of using screws on the mitered frame. The whole point of mitered joins is to not use screws. But, given the time it took to make the cuts, screws and glue were chosen to speed up the process.

I need to improve making flush corners on miter joins. I realized later I should use the drywall T-square or get a right-angle square. Also, since these are framing 2" x 4"s, not all were perfectly straight, so I need to allow myself some variance.

### Fastening the boards

Here I entertained the idea of pocket holes from the inside, but chose to countersink from the top. The screws are exposed and not asthetic. But, again, just went for speed

During the fastening, I had to procure new screws. Before, I used 3" construction screws that were about $10 for 75. I decided to go on the cheap and buy 3" general purpose screws that were $6 for 75. I quickly realized that screws matter and that it said on the box: not to be used with treated lumber. The screws fought my driver after going in half way.

### Fastening the legs

After the design, cut, and fit debachle, the fastening was the easiest. I used 4.5" lag bolts, two 0.25" washers, and a wing nut to keep the leg in place. The washers allow the leg to swing in and out. The wing nut keeps it tight enough to allow both swinging and locking in position. I am aware that the wing nut might get lost over time.

## Edge

Since this was not an indoor project, I did not edge the product. I did take a hammer and rough up the sharper corners of the frame.

## Fill

Since this was not an indoor project, I did not hneed to fill the gaps between the boards and frame or the gaps between the mitered frame.

## Sand

Since this was not an indoor project, I did not sand the material. The board was already sanded plywood, so the surface was smooth. The frames were painted over, so the markings were covered up without sanding.

## Color

### Creating a stencil

For the logo, I used the local library's makerspace to cut out the logo on a piece of carboard using the laser cutter from a PNG file. I emailed the file to the library and they were able to cut it out in less than 10 minutes. The cardboard was weak, so I applied duct tape to reinforce the cutout. This prevented the paint from soaking into the cardboard.

Keeping the stencil tight and flat to the board was a challenge. Using spray paint allowed some of paint to run under the stencil creating a shadow on the edges. I ended up brushing the paint with the stencil to go for a tigher edge on the logo.

### To spray or brush?

Originally, I decided that this would be easy with spray paint since I had 6 boards to paint. I decided to go to with a black and gray board face with white lines towards the circle. There would be a logo in the bottom-center of the board in green and white.

For larger faces separated by tape, I sprayed the gray portion and rolled the black portion. Rolling was simpler and more efficient that spraying the larger areas. To keep the edges of the larger faces, double check the tape is tight to the board on every inch otherwise it won't look as tight.

For the detailed logo, I sprayed the green paint and brushed the white paint. The edges of the green portion came out nicer when I increased my distance, but increase the dust that carried over outside the stencil. The edges of the white portion were terrible as the stencil pooled paint and created drops. Using stencils, the key is to maintain the right distance with spray paint and ensure tight coverage to keep the paint and dust inside the lines.

### Read the instructions

After switching from spray paint, I purchased small can of paint from same section at Home Depot. I later realized it was enamel for metal after I had already applied the "paint" diretly to the board without primer. Upon further research, the different coloring applications have different adhesive properties to different product materials. Until experience commits these combinations to memory, the coloring application can is the best source to instruct for each project.

Enamel is a good protectant for outdoor products, but requires primer. And, two coats of enamel is a good idea for long-term protection.

## Seal

Enthusiast cornhole board makers recommend 5 coats of polyurethane or polyacrilic to allow for the bags to slide on the board. I chose to apply 3 coats of polyacrylic before running out.
